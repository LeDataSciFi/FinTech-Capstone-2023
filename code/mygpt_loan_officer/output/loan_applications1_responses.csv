Based on the information provided, we would not recommend approving this loan application. The primary reason for this is the high debt-to-income ratio.

This means that the applicant is using a large percentage of their income to make debt payments, which leaves them with less money to cover other expenses. Additionally, the applicant has a low credit score, which is another factor that could make it difficult for them to make their loan payments on time."
