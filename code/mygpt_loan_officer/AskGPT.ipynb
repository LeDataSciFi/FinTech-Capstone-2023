    "\n",
    "To run this code, you need an API key from Open AI. This involves giving them your credit card and setting up spending limits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using it\n",
    "\n",
    "I run this file locally via Jupyterlab, so it's in a folder with `gpt_api.txt` which contains my API key. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run this file in Google Colab, you _could_ directly type your API key into the notebook below, **but this is a bad idea.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, one common way is to store the API key in a file on your Google Drive and then access it from the Colab notebook. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    Create a new text file on your Google Drive and store your API key in it. Name the file something like `gpt_api.txt`.\n",
    "1.    Mount your Google Drive to the Google Colab notebook by running the following code block.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import openai\n",
    "    from google.colab import drive\n",
    "    drive.mount('/content/drive')\n",
    "    with open('/content/drive/gpt_api.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "        openai.api_key = f.read().strip()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "1.     This will prompt you to click on a link to authorize the connection. Follow the instructions, and copy the authorization code into the input box that appears in the Colab notebook. You can now continue on. "

The primary reason for this is the high debt-to-income ratio. The applicant has a debt-to-income ratio of over 60%, which is considered to be very high. This means that the applicant is using a large percentage of their income to make debt payments, which leaves them with less money to cover other expenses. Additionally, the applicant has a low credit score, which is another factor that could make it difficult for them to make their loan payments on time.  \n",
