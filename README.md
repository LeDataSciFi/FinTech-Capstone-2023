# Welcome everyone!

This is Xiaozhe's branch, __I have imported necessary packages for cenpy library__ but things happens, if you can please read over my error message and provide some insight.
I believe the code I wrote is right for selecting different variables from US census API by using cenpy library, but the ```merging code is definitely not right``` as I did not select the import datafile
